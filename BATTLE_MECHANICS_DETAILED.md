# Enhanced Battle Mechanics Documentation

## Client Request Summary
The client requested detailed visibility into the battle mechanics to verify correctness and understand the underlying logic. They wanted to see:
- Individual dice rolls with modifiers
- Step-by-step calculations
- Breakdown of each phase
- Clear explanation of rerolls and special abilities

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Detailed Skirmish Phase Logging
**BEFORE:** Simple outcome statement
```
Matchup 1: cav (3) vs heavy (2)
Army A's cav wins - Army B's heavy routed.
```

**AFTER:** Complete breakdown with individual calculations
```
=== Skirmish Matchup 1 ===
Army A's cav (Lancers) vs Army B's heavy (None)
Army A Skirmish: Base(1) + Enhancement(2) = 3
Army B Skirmish: Base(0) + Enhancement(0) = 2
Army A Bold Trait Bonus: +2 (General Level 3/2 rounded up)
Army A Final Skirmish: 3 + 2 = 5

Dice Rolls:
Army A: Roll(4) + Skirmish(5) = 9
Army B: Roll(2) + Skirmish(2) = 4

Result: Army A wins by 5
Lancer Special: Difference 5 >= 3, forcing destruction roll
Army B's heavy destruction roll: 2 (destroyed on 1-2)
Army B's heavy DESTROYED by lancer charge!
```

```

### 4. Detailed Routed Unit Recovery
**BEFORE:** Basic success/failure

### 5. Enhanced Destruction Phase with Individual Rolls
**BEFORE:** Bulk destruction
```
Army A destroys 2 of Army B's brigades.
```

**AFTER:** Individual unit destruction rolls
```
=== Army A Brigade Destruction Rolls ===
Each surviving brigade rolls d6 - destroyed on 1-2, survives on 3-6
Merciless trait active: destroys on 1-3 instead of 1-2

    cav (Lancers): Rolled 4 ✓ Survives (destroyed on 1-2)
    heavy (None): Rolled 2 💀 DESTROYED (destroyed on 1-2)
    ranged (Sharpshooters): Rolled 6 ✓ Survives (destroyed on 1-2)
Army A losses: 1 brigades destroyed
```

### 6. Comprehensive Post-Battle Action Report
**BEFORE:** Basic general promotions
```
General Marcus: Rolled 5 - PROMOTED!
```

**AFTER:** Complete action report with rerolls
```
=== POST-BATTLE ACTION REPORT ===
All surviving brigades and generals roll for final casualties and promotions.
Brigade survival: Destroyed on 1-2, survives on 3-6
General fate: Captured on 1, promoted on 5-6, no effect on 2-4

--- Army A Final Brigade Casualty Rolls ---
cav (Lancers): Rolled 4 ✓ SURVIVES (destroyed on 1-2)
ranged (Sharpshooters): Rolled 1 💀 DESTROYED (destroyed on 1-2)
Army A post-battle casualties: 1/2 brigades destroyed
