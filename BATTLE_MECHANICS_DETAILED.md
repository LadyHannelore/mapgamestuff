# Enhanced Battle Mechanics Documentation

## Client Request Summary
The client requested detailed visibility into the battle mechanics to verify correctness and understand the underlying logic. They wanted to see:
- Individual dice rolls with modifiers
- Step-by-step calculations
- Breakdown of each phase
- Clear explanation of rerolls and special abilities

## Enhancements Made

### 1. Detailed Skirmish Phase Logging
**BEFORE:** Simple outcome statement
```
Matchup 1: cav (3) vs heavy (2)
Army A's cav wins - Army B's heavy routed.
```

**AFTER:** Complete breakdown with individual calculations
```
=== Skirmish Matchup 1 ===
Army A's cav (Lancers) vs Army B's heavy (None)
Army A Skirmish: Base(1) + Enhancement(2) = 3
Army B Skirmish: Base(0) + Enhancement(0) = 2
Army A Bold Trait Bonus: +2 (General Level 3/2 rounded up)
Army A Final Skirmish: 3 + 2 = 5

Dice Rolls:
Army A: Roll(4) + Skirmish(5) = 9
Army B: Roll(2) + Skirmish(2) = 4

Result: Army A wins by 5
Lancer Special: Difference 5 >= 3, forcing destruction roll
Army B's heavy destruction roll: 2 (destroyed on 1-2)
Army B's heavy DESTROYED by lancer charge!
```

### 2. Enhanced Pitch Phase with Unit-by-Unit Breakdown
**BEFORE:** Basic totals only
```
Army A pitch: 15
Army B pitch: 12
```

**AFTER:** Detailed calculation for each unit
```
=== Army A Pitch Calculation ===
    cav (Lancers): Roll(5) + Base(1) + Enhancement(1) = 7
    heavy (None): Roll(3) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) = 4
    ranged (Sharpshooters): Roll(6) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) = 7
    General Marcus (Lvl 3): +3
    Brilliant Trait: +3 (double general level)
Army A Total Pitch: 24

=== Army B Pitch Calculation ===
    heavy (None): Roll(2) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) = 3
    heavy (None): Roll(4) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) = 5
    ranged (None): Roll(1) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) = 2
    General Helena (Lvl 2): +2
Army B Total Pitch: 12

Pitch Comparison: Army A(24) vs Army B(12)
Army A wins pitch phase by 12
```

### 3. Comprehensive Rally Phase Logging
**BEFORE:** Simple totals
```
Army A rally: 8
Army B rally: 6
```

**AFTER:** Unit-by-unit rally calculations
```
=== Army A Rally Calculation ===
    cav (Lancers): Roll(4) + Base(0) + Enhancement(2) + Garrison(0) + Trait(1) = 7
    heavy (None): Roll(6) + Base(1) + Enhancement(0) + Garrison(0) + Trait(1) = 8
    ranged (Sharpshooters): Roll(3) + Base(0) + Enhancement(0) + Garrison(2) + Trait(1) = 6
    Inspiring Trait: +2 (rally reroll bonus)
Army A Total Rally: 23

Rally Comparison: Army A(23) vs Army B(14)
Army A wins rally phase by 9
```

### 4. Detailed Routed Unit Recovery
**BEFORE:** Basic success/failure
```
cav (Lancers): Rolled 5 - Rallied back to battle!
```

**AFTER:** Clear pass/fail criteria with visual indicators
```
=== Army A Routed Unit Recovery ===
Attempting to rally 2 routed unit(s):
    cav (Lancers): Rolled 5 ‚úì RALLIED (need 4+)
    light (Rangers): Rolled 3 ‚úó Still routed (need 4+)
Army A rally results: 3 active, 1 still routed
```

### 5. Enhanced Destruction Phase with Individual Rolls
**BEFORE:** Bulk destruction
```
Army A destroys 2 of Army B's brigades.
```

**AFTER:** Individual unit destruction rolls
```
=== Army A Brigade Destruction Rolls ===
Each surviving brigade rolls d6 - destroyed on 1-2, survives on 3-6
Merciless trait active: destroys on 1-3 instead of 1-2

    cav (Lancers): Rolled 4 ‚úì Survives (destroyed on 1-2)
    heavy (None): Rolled 2 üíÄ DESTROYED (destroyed on 1-2)
    ranged (Sharpshooters): Rolled 6 ‚úì Survives (destroyed on 1-2)
Army A losses: 1 brigades destroyed
```

### 6. Comprehensive Post-Battle Action Report
**BEFORE:** Basic general promotions
```
General Marcus: Rolled 5 - PROMOTED!
```

**AFTER:** Complete action report with rerolls
```
=== POST-BATTLE ACTION REPORT ===
All surviving brigades and generals roll for final casualties and promotions.
Brigade survival: Destroyed on 1-2, survives on 3-6
General fate: Captured on 1, promoted on 5-6, no effect on 2-4

--- Army A Final Brigade Casualty Rolls ---
cav (Lancers): Rolled 4 ‚úì SURVIVES (destroyed on 1-2)
ranged (Sharpshooters): Rolled 1 üíÄ DESTROYED (destroyed on 1-2)
Army A post-battle casualties: 1/2 brigades destroyed

--- Army A Victory Rerolls ---
As the victor, Army A may reroll destroyed brigades:
  ranged (Sharpshooters): Reroll 5 ‚úì SAVED (survives on 3+)
Victory rerolls saved 1/1 brigades

--- General Fate Rolls ---
General Marcus (Brilliant, Lvl 3): Rolled 6 ‚Üí PROMOTED
  General Marcus is now Level 4
General Helena (Cautious, Lvl 2): Rolled 3 ‚Üí No effect
```

## Testing the Enhanced System

1. Open the battle simulator in your browser
2. Set up two armies with different unit types and enhancements
3. Assign generals with different traits (try Brilliant, Bold, Merciless)
4. Run a battle and observe the detailed logging

You'll now see every single dice roll, calculation, and modifier applied throughout the entire battle, giving you complete transparency into whether the system is working correctly.

## Benefits for Client Review

1. **Verification**: Can check if calculations are mathematically correct
2. **Understanding**: Can see exactly how each trait and enhancement affects combat
3. **Debugging**: Can identify any issues with specific mechanics
4. **Balancing**: Can evaluate if certain combinations are overpowered
5. **Learning**: Can understand the system mechanics fully

The enhanced logging provides complete transparency while maintaining the same core battle mechanics from the original tutorial specification.
