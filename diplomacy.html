            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">Diplomacy is how nations interact ‚Äî whether it be forging friendships, making alliances, starting rivalries, or crafting betrayals.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">This is done through the regional threads. If you wish to engage in diplomacy with more than one nation then it will become an event. If you wish to explore the background of a diplomatic mission you may do it in a long-form roleplay post, and it will be graded. Normal short-form diplomacy will not be graded.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Negotiations must be posted, through roleplaying your deals. A simple "we ally" isn't enough. Make it immersive: a treaty signing, a diplomatic envoy, an exchange of gifts, etc.</p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-red-600">Therefore there should be no out of character deals. No "meta" alliances made behind the curtain.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card fade-in mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">Treaties</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">A treaty is a formal agreement between two or more nations.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Signing a treaty requires a clear list of the signatories, and this list cannot be changed at any time between posting for approval and the treaty's abolition. Each category allows you to have signed a maximum of 3 treaties, with your first in that category costing nothing, your second costing 100 silver, and your third coating 200 silver.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If you want to include more people into your treaty, you must abolish the current one and resubmit it as a new treaty. The above costs will apply if applicable. Everyone who wants to be a signatory must have been involved with its creation in RP or diplomacy.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Treaties with multiple mechanical clauses must be posted as separate treaties in their respective categories. This means that if you are already capped in one that would apply, you cannot sign the treaty.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Breaking a treaty gives the other signatories a diplomatic insult justification.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Unions cannot sign treaties as one unit and must be separate signatories on treaties.</p>
            <p class="mb-6">A treaty naturally comes to an end when all of the clauses have been fulfilled.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">As part of a Peace deal, or by manipulation through diplomacy, you may acquire tributaries. These tributaries:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>Act as resource or silver slaves</li>
                <li>Cannot simply refuse to provide you with your tribute, but will always have access to the Independence Justification</li>
                <li>Are able to garner support from your neighbors, granting them the Liberation Justification</li>
                <li>Cannot have land annexed</li>
                <li>Are able to be wholly traded as part of a land trade</li>
                <li>May be garrisoned by 3 overlord brigades</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="mb-4">Acquiring a Tributary is simple, you either win a war where that is a peace treaty option, or they willingly submit to you through a diplomatic treaty. You must be adjacent by land or sea, or have coastal cities within tiles to establish a tributary diplomatically</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You can never have more than 2 tributaries at a time, but your tributaries may have tributaries of their own.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Tributaries are mechanically independent from your nation, so their status will not affect expansions, trade, or military action. The overlord may committ 3 brigades to them, and may use those brigades in any wars involving the tributary.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If one tributary declares an independence war, the other may join them against you should they decide to. Independence and Liberation wars are the only way to end a Tributary unless the overlord pays 50 silver in reparation fees to release them. A Tributary declaring a war, being lost, or being released, reverts the brigades to the standard national army of the overlord.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A Tributary must pay either 40 silver, OR 5 resources, to their overlord every map cycle. This is determined by the overlord.</p>
            <p>You may trade a tributary to another player, following the standard land trading rules. The tributary retains all land and the treaty is shifted to the new player. Tributaries may also be taken following a war in place of land.</p>
