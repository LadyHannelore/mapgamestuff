            <h2 class="section-title">ü§ù Diplomacy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The main way to conduct Diplomacy is through Diplomats. Diplomats can be hired for <strong>4 Luxuries</strong>, and cost <strong>1 Luxury to upkeep every month</strong>. You may move a Diplomat to another player's nation once per week by requesting it in your Private Room. While in a nation, Diplomats can perform different Diplomatic Missions to accomplish goals. In addition, whenever you send a Diplomat to a nation, a private channel is opened up between the two parties to speak.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">There are 4 types of Diplomatic Missions; Treaty Signing, Land Exchange, Vassal Contracts, and Religious Conversion. A Diplomat may only perform 1 Diplomatic Mission a week.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title border-b pb-2">üìú Treaty Signing</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The premier form of Diplomatic Action, treaties are formal agreements between two or more nations. Signing a treaty requires a clear list of the signatories, and this list cannot be changed at any time between posting for approval and the treaty's abolition. Treaties always have a cost in Luxuries which varies depending on the complexity, potential effects, and number of signatories.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Breaking a treaty gives the other signatories a War Justification.</p>

                    <li>1. You determine what the treaty is for.</li>

                    <li>3. You determine any additional parts of the treaty you want to include.</li>
                    <li>4. You determine trigger conditions for each thing in the treaty.</li>
                    <li>5. You determine how long the treaty lasts, and any ways to end it early.</li>
                    <li>6. You determine enforced penalties for breaking the treaty.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="text-green-700 mt-4">Once the treaty is approved and all parties sign with üñäÔ∏è, the treaty goes into effect.</p>

                <p class="text-yellow-700 mb-4">By default, treaties are announced after they go into effect. However, they may also be signed in secret, which costs additional Luxuries. Secret treaties are not announced, however any foreign Diplomats in a secret treaty's signatory nation has a 1-in-6 chance every week of discovering the treaty.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">As part of a Peace deal, or by manipulation through diplomacy, you may acquire tributaries. These tributaries:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li>Act as resource tributaries</li>
                <li>Cannot simply refuse to provide you with your tribute, but will always have access to the Independence Justification</li>
                <li>Are able to garner support from your neighbors, granting them the Liberation Justification</li>
                <li>Cannot have land annexed</li>
                <li>Are able to be wholly traded as part of a land trade</li>
                <li>May be garrisoned by 3 overlord brigades</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4">Acquiring a Tributary is simple, you either win a war where that is a peace treaty option, or they willingly submit to you through a diplomatic treaty. You must be adjacent by land or sea, or have coastal cities within tiles to establish a tributary diplomatically</p>
            <p class="mb-4">You can never have more than 2 tributaries at a time, but your tributaries may have tributaries of their own.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Tributaries are mechanically independent from your nation, so their status will not affect expansions, trade, or military action. The overlord may committ 3 brigades to them, and may use those brigades in any wars involving the tributary.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">If one tributary declares an independence war, the other may join them against you should they decide to. Independence and Liberation wars are the only way to end a Tributary unless the overlord pays resources in reparation fees to release them. A Tributary declaring a war, being lost, or being released, reverts the brigades to the standard national army of the overlord.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A Tributary must pay either Bullion, OR 5 resources, to their overlord every map cycle. This is determined by the overlord.</p>
            <p>You may trade a tributary to another player, following the standard land trading rules. The tributary retains all land and the treaty is shifted to the new player. Tributaries may also be taken following a war in place of land.</p>
