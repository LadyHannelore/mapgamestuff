                <p class="text-green-700 mb-4">
                    Resources are gained at the beginning of each week, with you receiving (by default) <strong>2 of a resource for each tile you own</strong> of the indicated resource type. Then, any upkeep you have will be deducted from your gains. What remains will be added (or subtracted‚Ä¶) to your national stockpile, tracked on the Player Sheet.
                </p>
                <p class="text-green-700">
                    The other primary way to gain resources is through <strong>Worldbuilding Submissions</strong>. You may also gain resources through Trading, Events, and Warfare.

                    Submissions of very low quality or effort may be denied, and text submissions should be at least 200 words. Exceptional work may be nominated into the Hall of Fame, where they will be posted prominently for everyone to see and receive additional resource rewards.

The effects are cumulative, so every previous penalty also occurs upon the beginning of the week.
