                Hegemony is a <strong>Discord-based grand strategy role-playing game</strong> that focuses on strategic resource management and warfare, nation/world building, competitive and cooperative community events, and roleplay. We have a consistent and close-knit community that we encourage others to become a part of.

                    First, we recommend reading the <strong>Resources</strong> and <strong>Cities</strong> tutorials at a minimum to begin spawning in, so you may make an informed decision regarding starting tiles. In addition, look at the most recent <strong>/main map/</strong> to see what territory is available, and familiarize yourself with the <strong>/Player Sheet/</strong>.

                <p class="text-green-700 mb-4">
                    Resources are gained at the beginning of each week, with you receiving (by default) <strong>2 of a resource for each tile you own</strong> of the indicated resource type. Then, any upkeep you have will be deducted from your gains. What remains will be added (or subtracted…) to your national stockpile, tracked on the Player Sheet.
                </p>
                <p class="text-green-700">
                    The other primary way to gain resources is through <strong>Worldbuilding Submissions</strong>. You may also gain resources through Trading, Events, and Warfare.

                    Though you generally cannot use resources you do not have stockpiled, you may end up negative on resources at the start of a turn if your upkeep is greater than your resource gain.
