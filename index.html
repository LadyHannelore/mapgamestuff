        <div class="card fade-in">
            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">Rules</h2>
            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Follow Discord TOS and Community Guidelines.</li>
                <li>The Use of AI is PROHIBITED for anything related to the mechanical playing of the game, including earning silver, winning tournaments, and establishing treaties.</li>
                <li>All players must read the tutorials before asking questions related to mechanics or gameplay.</li>
                <li>Administrators ALWAYS have the final say in anything on this server. Personal conflicts between players and moderators, disagreement on rulings, or anything else that needs an administrator should be brought to their attention swiftly, and their arbitration should be respected.</li>
                <li>Making in game decisions based on out of game events and opinions, while not outright banned, is heavily frowned upon. This is ultimately a game based on Roleplay, and we expect a concerted effort to avoid metagaming.</li>
                <li>No promotion of any other servers is to be permitted without Administrator approval.</li>
                <li>Warfare is a key part of this game and the failure to act with respect and courtesy toward your enemies will not be tolerated.</li>
                <li>Sharing any visual evidence of your War Room is grounds for an immediate Timeout with no exceptions. DO NOT SHARE PICTURES OF YOUR WAR ROOM. You may discuss the contents with anyone, so long as there is no visual evidence shared between you.</li>
