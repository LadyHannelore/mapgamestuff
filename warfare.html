            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 border-b pb-2">The Basics</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">War is fought between 2 or more nations with a valid Justification. Wars are fought with Brigades, which act as individual units. Generals allow you to combine brigades into an Army.</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Action Cycle:</strong> Wars run on a 3-day action cycle (Tue-Thu, Fri-Sun) that determines allowed actions (organization, movement, combat).</li>
                <li><strong>Brigade Cap:</strong> Starts at 2 and increases with cities (T1: +1, T2: +3, T3: +5).</li>
                <li><strong>War College:</strong> Grants General benefits and levels up with General retirements and won wars.</li>
                <li><strong>Peace Treaties:</strong> End wars and must follow justification stipulations. Carry a 2-week non-aggression pact.</li>
                <li><strong>War Room:</strong> A private channel for all your warfare decisions.</li>

            <p class="mb-4">Every offensive war requires a valid justification. Each has specific requirements, victory/defeat conditions, and peace terms.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">When taking tiles in a peace deal, city tiles have a higher cost:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Tier 1 City:</strong> Costs 2 tiles.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>Generals are your commanders, and their job is to run an army. Every General has a randomly assigned trait, which grants bonuses or special abilities to their army.</li>
                <li>Generals are assumed universally at every city when not leading an army, but they must be attached to a brigade at a city to form an army. They may then go around collecting other units until they reach the 8 brigade cap.</li>
                <li>Generals have a level, which is scaled from 1–10. When a General reaches Level 10, he may be retired, and increase your war college level by 1. If your war college is already max level, you would instead receive 300 silver.
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-6">
                        <li>Your General Level is a direct bonus to your pitch value in battle. You add the general level number as a base increase per round, making Generals extremely impactful to the outcome of a battle.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Generals themselves have a cap, determined by your war college level. Your cap starts at 1. Generals cost 100 silver for every general you already have, so if you have no generals you will get one for free, or if you have 2 generals your next one costs 200 silver.</li>
                <li>General Traits are rolled randomly when the general is created, or rerolled when using 3 gems to do so. The traits are listed below:</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">General Traits</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">
                <li><strong>1 Ambitious:</strong> -1 to the number needed to promote after a battle.</li>
                <li><strong>2 Bold:</strong> One of your skirmishers get a bonus equal to half the general's level, rounded up.</li>
                <li><strong>3 Brilliant:</strong> This General gets double his general level during the Pitch.</li>
                <li><strong>4 Brutal:</strong> Pillaging resources succeeds on a 5-6. Razing a city also counts as sacking it.</li>
                <li><strong>5 Cautious:</strong> You may declare the skirmishing stage to be skipped this battle.</li>
                <li><strong>6 Chivalrous:</strong> During the Action Report, you may choose to allow your enemy to have an extra reroll on their Destruction dice, in order to get -1 siege timer on your next city siege with this army.</li>
                <li><strong>7 Confident:</strong> +2 to Defense and +1 to Rally for all brigades.</li>
                <li><strong>8 Defiant:</strong> +2 to rally for all brigades.</li>
                <li><strong>9 Disciplined:</strong> +1 to pitch and rally for all brigades.</li>
                <li><strong>10 Dogged:</strong> This General may choose 2 brigades to assist any battle occurring on an adjacent tile. These brigades return after the battle.</li>
                <li><strong>11 Heroic:</strong> +1 to Rally for all brigades. If the battle would be lost, this general may sacrifice himself to return all brigades to a new pitch, granting his general level as a pitch bonus to all brigades for the remainder of the battle.</li>
                <li><strong>12 Inspiring:</strong> All brigades get a free reroll on their rally rolls, once per rally stage. Celebrating with this army gives +2 rally instead of +1.</li>
                <li><strong>13 Lucky:</strong> This General, when a 1 is rolled on the promotion die, may reroll the promotion die once per battle.</li>
                <li><strong>14 Mariner:</strong> +1 to army movement while embarked. This General may siege cities from a landing, and this army may immediately move after embarking.</li>
                <li><strong>15 Merciless:</strong> During the action report, enemy brigades are destroyed on a 1-3.</li>
                <li><strong>16 Prodigious:</strong> This General gets an additional 2 levels. These levels are lost if this trait is rerolled.</li>
                <li><strong>17 Relentless:</strong> +1 to army movement on land. This General may choose to pursue an enemy army that retreats, instead of continuing their original move.</li>
                <li><strong>18 Resolute:</strong> +3 to defense for all brigades.</li>
                <li><strong>19 Wary:</strong> You are alerted when an enemy can see this army. Your Army can see one tile further away (stacks with sentry team). Any enemy Generals within this army's sight have their trait revealed.</li>
                <li><strong>20 Zealous:</strong> +1 Rally for all brigades. When in a holy war, this number goes to +2 rally and +1 pitch for all brigades.</li>
